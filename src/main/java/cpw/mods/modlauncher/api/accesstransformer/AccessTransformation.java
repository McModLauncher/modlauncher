/**
 * A class that allows easy transformation of access flags.
 * ATs get run before the transformers are called to transform the class/method/field
 * It is NOT possible to downgrade the access. F.E. if an AT wants protected but the class/field/method is already public, this will throw an exception
 * ATs will get merged if more ATs want to modify the same class/method/field. See some examples below.
 * <br>
 * Example:
 * There are two ATs that transform the same method:
 * <p>One wants protected access, the other one public access. In this case, the method will be public.</p>
 * <p>One wants final access, the other wants to keep. In this case, the method will keep the flag.</p>
